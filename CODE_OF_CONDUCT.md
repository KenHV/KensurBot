# Code of Conduct

All participants of RaphielGang are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct,
both online and during in-person events that are hosted and/or associated with RaphielGang.


### The Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation
in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.


### The Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful**:  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Itâ€™s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**: Not everyone are perfect, you can get some critism of your works from us, but it's not means that we don't accepting your contribution, we just want you to fixing it and making it better.
* **Referring to people by their preferred pronouns/words**, but we do not have standardized gender-neutral pronouns/words, so your milleage may vary.
* **Do not attack somebody because you have a different opinion** All opinions are accepted as long as they are reasonable, and everyone have right to shouting their opinion.
* **Just chill :D**
* **Don't forget, nobody is perfect, mistakes can be made**
* **Equality is not a privilege, it's a rule!**

### Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

  * **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, public or private harassment**
  * **Publishing others' private information (Doxing)** such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
  * **Not being respectful to reasonable communication boundaries** such as 'leave me alone,' 'go away,' or 'Fuck off.'
  * **The usage of sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances**
  * **Demonstrating the graphics or any other content you know may be considered disturbing**
  * **Assuming or promoting any kind of inequality** including but not limited to: age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, nationality and race, personal appearance, religion, or sexual identity and orientation
  * **Drug promotion of any kind**
  * **Attacking personal tastes**
  * **Other conduct which you know could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting**
