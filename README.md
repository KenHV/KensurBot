## What is it?

KensurBot is a modular Telegram userbot running on Python 3 with an SQLAlchemy
database.

Based on [Paperplane](https://github.com/RaphielGang/Telegram-UserBot) and
[ProjectBish](https://github.com/adekmaulana/ProjectBish) userbot. I made this
fork to cherry-pick some modules I needed. Eventually I started messing with the
code and here we are.
